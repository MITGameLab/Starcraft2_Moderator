	Map refers to the name of the SCII map.
	DataLog is saved as DataLog_Player1 and DataLog_Player2 respectively.

In General they will be saved under in the same directory of SCII.     (.\UserLogs\(Map)\(DataLog.txt)

We can use two methods for tracking the files:
	1. Devoted thread that checks when the file is updated and then runs analysis
	2. watchService - Java 7 service that will automatically watch directories/files
